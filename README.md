After launch, open `_Config_DO_THIS_FIRST.ipynb`, fill in your API details
and execute the notebook. Note that your API key will need to enable access to
the correct endpoints in use by each notebook.

Once your API details are stored, you can use the other notebooks to try
working with some of the different endpoints available.
